## Here in this app , 
1) I have created the login and sign up flow with firebase, user login is persisted till the momemnt user not logged out manually. 
2) After successful login with the help of ticket master api events shonw, currently to show keyword and city ( city full city name require exact case) to show the results
3) view details page: details of the event with multiple images, map , seat selction routing handles
4) profile page to show username, logout and biometric toggele ( some enhancement required)
5) if login or singup time error shown , please clear data or reinstall app, may be due to firbase app tokens causing issue
6) I tried without expo framework but spend lot of time to resolve firebase hermes issue , i think due to version mismatch not sure , hence migrated all code expo framework,
7) Expo not allowing to create a env due to some restriction hence credentials are stored in constants
